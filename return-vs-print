#Difference between PRINT and RETURN

def function_that_prints():
    print("I printed")

def function_that_returns():
    return "I returned"

f1 = function_that_prints()
#Automatically prints "I printed"

f2 = function_that_returns()
#Does not print anything to the console. Only stored a value

print(f1)
#The value stored in f1 is NONE because the function did not have a return statement

print(f2)
#The function_that_returns stored the RETURN value in f2
#So when we printed f2, we saw "I returned"
